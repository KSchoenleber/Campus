Campus is an intertemporal [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) optimisation model for capacity expansion planning and unit commitment for distributed energy systems. Its name, latin for city, stems from its origin as a model for optimisation for urban energy systems. Since then, it has been adapted to multiple scales from neighbourhoods to continents.
